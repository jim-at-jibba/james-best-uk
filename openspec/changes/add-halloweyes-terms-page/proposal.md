## Why
The HallowEyes mobile application needs a terms and conditions page to provide legal terms for users, as required for mobile app distribution and to protect the developer's intellectual property rights.

## What Changes
- Add a new terms and conditions page at `/terms` in the root of the portfolio website
- Create a standalone page with the provided legal content for HallowEyes
- No menu links or navigation changes required
- Page should follow the existing site design patterns and accessibility standards

## Impact
- Affected specs: New capability for legal pages
- Affected code: New Astro page file in `src/pages/`
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Improves legal compliance for the HallowEyes project
