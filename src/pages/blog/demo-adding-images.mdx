import BlogImage from '../../components/BlogImage.astro';
import demoImage from '../../assets/blog-images/demo-coding.webp';

I've just added the ability to include images in my blog posts! Here's a demo of how it works.

<BlogImage src={demoImage} alt="Person working on a laptop" caption="Working on code - photo by Michael Dam" />

## How It Works

I can now use the `BlogImage` component in my MDX posts to include optimized images with optional captions. The images are stored in `src/assets/blog-images/` and processed by Astro's image optimization.

## Key Features

- **Optimized** - Astro automatically optimizes images for performance
- **Responsive** - Images scale appropriately on different screen sizes
- **Lazy loading** - Images load as they come into viewport
- **Captions** - Optional captions below images

This makes it much easier to include visuals in my posts!
